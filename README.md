# Angular Fundamentals Exploration

## Angular is running!

When you opened this project, <b>npm start</b> was executed automatically.
These instructions that you are reading are in the app component
(app.component.html); replace this content with your own to get started!

## An API server is available in this project.

You can run this project without the API server, but if you want to make http
calls to an API Server:

- Open a new console window, by clicking the + in the top-right corner of the terminal window (which is below the coding window).
- In that console window, run npm run server to start the api server.

The API server serves up the sample list of products that you can find in app.cmopnent.ts and that you can see below. The API server is a simple express server and you can modify it by changing the file at /api-server/index.js file.

You can proxy your api with `proxy.conf.json` in Stackblitz just like you would on your local computer.

## Product Data and Image Files

This project has provided some sample product data and images for you to use! The images are in the /src/assets/images folder and the product data is in the app.component.ts file (and in the api-server/index.js file).
